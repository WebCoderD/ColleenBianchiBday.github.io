        <article> <big>Colleen has often described herself as "amazing" and receives plenty of "accolades" but what does this really mean?</big> <br />
            Well for me it means she cares deeply about the ones she loves and instinctively will want to do everythings 
            she can to help. Colleen's committment to her job, students and family is admirable. When I speak of my mum, 
            I know she is very different to other mums and I am so grateful for this. She has a wild and fun side that 
            comes with her sense of life. I share everything with her (thank you for our walks) and am appreciative 
            of her (VERY) active role in ensuring I am on a good path in life. Colleen is quite unique and I am lucky that 
            I have this crazy and involved - (sometimes heavily so) - woman as my mother.
